# Sketches
## General info

I'm creating digital, animated sketches along with the course: [Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/2729-creative-coding-making-visuals-with-javascript/) by Bruno Imbrizi on Domestica.
I'm using [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) - a framework for making generative artwork in JavaScript and the browser.
